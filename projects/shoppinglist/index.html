                    <h4>Reflections</h4>
                    <p><strong>What specific user feedback did you receive about the app’s features or usability?</strong> The product owners appreciated the auto-sorting feature, as it improved focus by prioritizing unpurchased items. They also praised the app's clean and intuitive design, which made it easy to use.</p>
                    <p><strong>Did you encounter any challenges working in a team? How did you address them?</strong> The main challenge was limited participation from team members, as their focus seemed to be on simply passing the course. I addressed this by taking responsibility for most of the work, ensuring the project’s success while also delivering high-quality results for the team.</p>
                    <p><strong>How does this project demonstrate your readiness for professional software engineering roles?</strong> This project showcases my technical skills in full-stack development, leadership qualities as a scrum master, and the ability to deliver functional and user-centric solutions.
